# GPG-Messaging


## Description
GPG (Open source version of Pretty Good Privacy) is an encryption model that many people use, but there are problems. The goal is security. The main issue is that there is not a very efficient way to exchange a public key with a recipient securely. Currently, the most secure method is to exchange keys in person. This is not always desirable. For example, someone can email a key to his/her intended recipient, but that email may get intercepted by another party. That conversation would no longer be secure. This platform will perform the key exchange for the user. This eliminates the worry created while meeting in person. Beyond that, users will sign up on the site, to download the desktop client. In the client, users will be able to create a message, encrypt it, and then send it either through the site itself or any other means they wish. When the other party receives the message, they will be able to de-crypt it in the desktop client as well. This is a very niche product and more than likely, only hyper security-oriented people would use it.
