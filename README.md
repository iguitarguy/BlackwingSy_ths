## Description
MIDI Controllers can be quite expensive (upwards of $200), and hard to come by for just entertainment purposes, and not only that, but the mapping software required to use these controllers may not be entirely user friendly, for those not familiar with the DJ'ing world.
Our application will convert a standard computer keyboard into a basic, easy to use midi controller, as well as serve as the mapping software. Mapping, in this instance, simply means assigning sound bites to specific buttons which will be as simple as clicking the button you want to map (within the app), and then selecting the desired sound file.


## Instructions
* Run the app
* In the app, click on the desired button to map out
* Browse through your files
* Select the file
* Click Open
* Repeat for remaining keys
* Once all keys are mapped, turn to your keyboard and mash away!*
* Download our app for Windows

###### Minimum System Requirements
* Java 8 Update 73 (Java 1.8.0_73)
* Computer keyboard

###### Recommended System Requirements
* Anti-Ghosting Keyboard

**_DISCLAIMERS_**
* Mash away responsibly. Please don't break your keyboard.
* For the best experience, try this app on keyboards that support anti-ghosting. If you do not own an anti-ghosting keyboard, you won't be able to press and hold more than 3 keys at a time.


## Application
For the moment being, our application will be written entirely in Java.


## Upcoming Features
* Record your sessions
* Export keystrokes
* Export session as a mp3 audio file for sharing
* Import keystrokes for editing


## Terminology
* **MIDI**: (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a protocol designed for recording and playing back music, which does not represent musical sound directly, but rather stores information on how the music is produced.

* **Mapping**: Assigning of sound bites to specific keys or buttons on your MIDI controller.

* **Ghosting**: the problem that some keyboard keys don't work when multiple keys are pressed simultaneously. It is typically the result of hardware that can't read the given key combination.


## Our Beginnings...
Originally meant to be a GPG Messaging platform project, BlackWing Sy_ths (formerly Armored Pigeon), opted to switch away from Encrypted messaging and switched to the DiskJockeying world, by creating a user friendly app that turns your keyboard into a MIDI controller.
