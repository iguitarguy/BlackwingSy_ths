## Description
MIDI Controllers can be quite expensive, and hard to come by for just entertainment purposes, and not only that, but the mapping software required to use these controllers may not be entirely user friendly, for those not familiar with the DJ'ing world.
Our application will convert a standard computer keyboard into a basic, easy to use midi controller, as well as serve as the mapping software. Mapping, in this instance, simply means assigning sound bites to specific buttons which will be as simple as clicking the button you want to map (within the app), and then selecting the desired sound file.


## Application
For the moment being, our application will be written entirely in Java.

## Upcoming Features
* Record your sessions
* Export keystrokes
* Export session as a mp3 audio file for sharing
* Import keystrokes for editing

## Documentation

### Once you have the app downloaded, run it.
* Click on the desired button to map
* Browse through your files
* Select the file
* Click Open
* Repeat for desired mapping

_Disclaimer_ due to hardware limitations, unless your keyboard supports anti-ghosting you will only be able to play three keys simultaneously (play sound at the same time). 

### Terminology
* MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a protocol designed for recording and playing back music, which does not represent musical sound directly, but rather stores information on how the music is produced.

* Mapping: Assigning of sound bites to specific keys or buttons on your MIDI controller.
