# GPG-Messaging

## Description
GPG (Open source version of Pretty Good Privacy) is an encryption model that many people use, but the problem is that currently there is not a very good way to exchange your public key with the person you wish to talk to securely. Right now the most secure way, which is the only way for there to be a point, currently is to exchange keys in person, which is not to desirable. Otherwise you could say email your key to someone, but that email may get intercepted by someone, and subsequently your conversation with said person is no longer secure. This platform will perform the key exchange for you so you don't have to worry about meeting in person. Beyond that you will be able to create a message on the site or in the terminal, encrypt it, and then send it either through the site itself or any other means they wish. When the other party receives the message they will be able to de-crypt it on the site or in the terminal as well. This is a very niche product and more than likely, only super security oriented people would use it.
