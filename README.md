## Description
[MIDI](https://github.com/soft-eng-practicum/gpg-messaging/#terminology) Controllers can be quite expensive (upwards of $200), and hard to come by for just entertainment purposes, and not only that, but the [mapping](https://github.com/soft-eng-practicum/gpg-messaging/#terminology) software required to use these controllers may not be entirely user friendly, for those not familiar with the DJ'ing world.
Our application will convert a standard computer keyboard into a basic, easy to use midi controller, as well as serve as the mapping software. Mapping, in this instance, simply means assigning sound bites to specific buttons which will be as simple as clicking the button you want to map (within the app), and then selecting the desired sound file. We aim to make this available to anyone, though those that get a little more benefit out of this app will be those people that have access to anti-[ghosting](https://github.com/soft-eng-practicum/gpg-messaging/#terminology) keyboards. It will only be a slight advantage, as you don't normally need to be pressing more than 3 keys at a time.


## Terminology
* **MIDI**: (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a protocol designed for recording and playing back music, which does not represent musical sound directly, but rather stores information on how the music is produced.

* **Mapping**: Assigning of sound bites to specific keys or buttons on your MIDI controller.

* **Ghosting**: the problem that some keyboard keys don't work when multiple keys are pressed simultaneously. It is typically **the result of hardware that can't read the given key combination.** Depending on the specific hardware, this often occurs when trying to press combinations of 3 or more keys at the same time.
